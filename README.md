FreeMind 项目介绍
FreeMind 是一个旨在实现人类自由的开源项目。我们的目标是通过自动化和技术创新，把人们从无聊的劳动中解放出来，使他们能够自由地追求自己真正想要追求的事情。我们相信，每个人都应该有机会探索自己的兴趣、发展自己的才能，而不是被日常琐事所束缚。

在 FreeMind，我们致力于结合所有可能的技术，如人工智能、机器人、物联网和各种硬件，来开发工具和解决方案，以减少重复性和繁琐的工作。通过这些工具，我们希望为每个人创造更多的自由时间，让他们能够专注于更加有意义和创造性的活动。

我们欢迎所有有志于实现这一目标的开发者和志愿者加入我们，共同推动这个自由的愿景。通过共享知识和协作，我们相信可以实现一个更加自由和富有创造力的世界。

About FreeMind
FreeMind is an open-source project aimed at achieving human freedom. Our goal is to liberate people from tedious and repetitive labor through automation and technological innovation, enabling them to freely pursue what they truly want. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to explore their interests and develop their talents without being burdened by mundane tasks.

At FreeMind, we are committed to leveraging all possible technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and various hardware, to develop tools and solutions that reduce repetitive and tedious work. Through these tools, we hope to create more free time for everyone, allowing them to focus on more meaningful and creative activities.

We welcome all developers and volunteers who share this vision to join us in advancing this goal. By sharing knowledge and collaborating, we believe we can create a freer and more creative world.
